This file is a development diary for the drupal module Qadmin

A short description
-------------------

This system provides a control panel to manage several aspects of business relationships, projects and products for Qumbia.ca and its clients.

How it works
------------

The UI provides a main interface available at /qadmin

On this interface you will find access to the following:

- Domain names
- Websites
- Projects
- Issues
- Email addresses
- Invoices
- Tasks
- Worksessions
- Billlines

(on the development side, a hook will be provided for other modules to provide sections here)

Domain names
------------

Let's start with an example usecase:

(1) Client clicks on Domain names
  (1.1) System checks the GoDaddy domain module.
    (1.1.1) System figures out that the domain name autodom.com was purchased through the system and the godaddy api, and finds all relevant info online.
  (1.2) System checks the WorldDomain domain module
    (1.2.1) System figures out that the domain name autodom2.com was purchased through the system and the worlddomain api.
  (1.3) System checks the other domain module
    (1.3.1) Other domain module cannot give an answer right away, it checks with the human responsible for entering domains in the system, by sending an email to that person with a specific URL to fill in after.
    (1.3.2) Other domain module returns a monitor as an answer.
(2) Domain API returns an incomplete List object back to the UI, wrapped in an Answer object.
(3) UI checks the List object, and gets the number of elements, which is between 2 and infinity.
(4) UI displays the two there are to display, and says that the list might be incomplete, check back later or be informed when the request is complete.
(5) Client logs out. 

(6) Client clicks on Domain names
